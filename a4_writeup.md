# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The most difficult part of tic tac toe was making the move function. It had the most code and took the most time. 
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
I would add a computer player to the game by making a generated player that made decisions like a human player. The computer would need to know the state of the board. 
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
To make sure the computer always makes the best possible move I would create a decision making process which would evaluate all the possible moves and make sure it picks the best move which would have the best outcome.
